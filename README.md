# Trophy Haunt

You are trapped in a room with ghosts that try to chase you and you have to collect all the trophies in the map to escape. (idk how it makes you escape) </br>
This is a first person shooter like game except that you can't shoot(oops). </br>
There are 3 fixed maps you can select from. (maps 2 & 3 are very hard)

Game deployed in this [website](https://trophyhaunt.vercel.app/)

*made by Lim Enoch (3C) and Kuan Yue Han (3C)*

## Controls
- wasd: moving
- spacebar: jump
- q: enable pointer lock (if not enabled already)
- mouse control / arrow keys (move mouse to pan the camera in X and Y axis, aka pitch and yaw)
- got buttons to do the same thing

## Relevance to themes
We think this game fits the main theme of "unknown" because the map is unknown and you have to wander around while avoiding all the ghosts.</br>
It matches the subtheme of "repeated" because you're playing the same map over and over unless you switch.</br>
It matches the subtheme of "taking over" because you're 'taking over' the trophies. (I know I'm very creative) 
*this is not forced at all*

## Info
This game is made for the RVHS GameJam 2023, their website is [here](https://rvhsgamejam.x10.mx/)
