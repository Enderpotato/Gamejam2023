# Trophy Haunt

You are trapped in a room with ghosts that try to chase you and you have to collect all the trophies in the map to win.
This is a first person shooter like game except that you cant shoot oops.
We think this game fits the theme of "unknown" because the map is unknown and you have to wander around while avoiding all the ghosts.
